# Image Effects

##  > Cubic Distortion
Distorts the screen using its coordinates. Can be a "speed" effect if negative values, a "fish-eye" effect if positive.

##  > Gradient Fog
A fog applying a fully editable gradient from the camera to the distance.

##  > Radial Blur
A very simple Radial Blur image effect.

##  > Vignette
A better looking, more efficient and colourable vignetting effect. Looks good on any resolution since it does not use a texture.
