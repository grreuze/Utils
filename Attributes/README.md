# Editor

##  > EditorConstAttribute
Use [EditorConst] on a constant property to be able to edit its value directly from the inspector (out of runtime, obviously).

##  > ScenePointAttribute
Use [ScenePoint] on a Vector3 to display it as a movable point in the scene view. Simulation space can be specified (World or Local)
